# action-reaction

“Action-Reaction Game” is a two dimensional graphics based multiplayer game that is formed on the user reactance (reflex).

The game is essentially played as follows: when an action such as a mathematical operation is shown user is expected to react the action whether it is true or false. Every correct findings of an action by user awards one point. The more points, the better :)

Mathematical operations, XOX game and color match are available as *actions*.
Single player and multi-player available and the game is controlled by switches of BASYS 3.

The game is written in VHDL and implemented via BASYS3 FPGA board for a 1280x720 (60 Hz) VGA monitor.

Some screenshots:

Note: All the pixels are calculated by hand and so drawn manually, as I was apparently unaware of bitmaps :)
